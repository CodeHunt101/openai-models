A personal project where I utilise the main OpenAI API premium models. <b>Calling the API is way less pricey than paying for ChatGPT premium!</b>

Since this is a paid API, if you would like access, please email me at `haroldtm55@gmail.com`, and I'll grant you free access.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Example using `gpt-4-0125-preview` text generation model

Provides text outputs in response to their inputs.

## Getting Started in Local

Note: Since this is a paid API, you need an access key. Feel free to contact me and I'll provide you with one.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
